Datatype
--------------
Every data is of some type. That type is known as datatype.
It is of two types.
1.Primitive datatype
2.Non-primitive datatype

Primitive Datatype
-------------------------
We will go for primitive datatype when we want to store a countable unit.
It is further divided into five types.
1.Number
2.String
3.Boolean
4.Null
5.Undefined

1.Number
--------------
It is used to store numbers,integers.
var a=5
type of a // output will be 'number'

2.String
-----------
It is a collection of characters, numbers and special characters
In JS String is declared between '  ' &" "
var s="xyz"
typeof s//string

3.Boolean
--------------
It contains two values. [True & False]
var d= true
typeof d//boolean

4.Null
-----------
var e=null
typeof e//null
If we want to store nothing inside of a variable then we can assign null into it.

5.Undefined
----------------
If I want to create a variable and if I am not assigning any value to it then it is called Undefined.
var t
typeof t//undefined


Non-Primitive Datatype
-------------------------------
We will go for non-primitive datatype when we want to store an uncountable variables.
